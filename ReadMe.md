# ClutterFree
The Spotify Desktop client developers seem to think that my computer monitor is a tablet or even a smartphone, decreasing the information density and cluttering my screen. 

This repository contains a theme for [spicetify](https://github.com/khanhas/spicetify-cli/wiki/Installation), a tool that lets you spice up the Spotify client.

# Disclaimer
Use spicetify at your own risk.

I'm not affiliated with Spotify or spicetify at all, just a paying customer that wants to get the most out of the former's services.
